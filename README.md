## 03 Word-Guess-Game

## Getting Started

## Description

The purpose of this HW assignment was to design a word guessing game that uses CSS, HTML, and Javascript. For this game I picked the theme of iconic movies. There are over 20 movies to guess from!

## Rules 

* The game won't start unless you press a key
* The amount of guesses is calculated based on word size 
* When a player wins the game score goes up by 1
* When the player loses the game is over
* Once you lose a player can keep playing
* You may play as much as you like 
* The total score will be reset if the browser is refreshed
